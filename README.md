# Image captioning

This is an implementation of an image captioning model in [Keras](keras.io), based off the example model from [the Keras guide](https://keras.io/preprocessing/sequence/), as well as [neuraltalk2](https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk2) and [im2txt](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/im2txt). Try it out at the `imgcap_image_model.ipynb` Python notebook!
